Hello Guys!
# What is it and how does it work?
- This is an AI-powered recipe generator that creates personalized recipes based on cuisine preferences and dietary restrictions. 
- It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for recipe generation and DALL-E 3 for food images.

# Features
- Recipe generation with AI
- AI-generated food images
- Dietary restrictions
- Modern UI
- Multiple cuisine options

# What you should do!
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Replace `your_api_key_here` with your OpenAI API key
- You need a `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (Required) [https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview](url)
- Never commit your `.env` file or expose your API keys. The `.env` file is included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

 # The boring stuff as you can see :(
- Backend: Flask
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 and DALL-E 3
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Styling: CSS

*I used AI to help generate some sudo code so I could write the code more easily*
